        <p><strong>Cook Time ~5hr</strong></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4 lb.</strong> boneless pork butt</li>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp.</strong> packed brown sugar</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> kosher salt</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> smoked paprika</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> garlic powder</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> ground cumin</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> onion powder</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> vegetable oil</li>
            <li><strong>12 oz.</strong> lager</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300Â°. Trim excess fat from pork and cut into large pieces to fit in a large Dutch oven</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and onion powder; season with black pepper. Rub all over pork (This can be done the night before)</li>
            <li>In large Dutch oven over medium high heat, heat oil. Working in batches, cook pork until browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side (Spices can burn quickly, so don't let it go for too long!) Pour beer around pork and cover with a lid</li>
            <li>Bake until pork is just beginning to turn tender, about 3 hours. Uncover and continue to bake until pork is very tender and easily pulls apart with a fork, 1 to 2 hours more</li>
            <li>Transfer pork to a cutting board, reserving pan drippings in pot, and let rest until ready to use</li>
        </ol>
